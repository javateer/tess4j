   * numbers, but we're telling the OCR that, as it tries to make its best guess what it's looking
   * at, the only permissible characters to consider it may be are the numbers. The test passes 
   * because these three characters look very much like the number 150. If we removed the whitelist
   * rule, allowing the default range to be any of the printable/typable characters you see on your
   * keyboard, then the OCR should have guessed the three characters instead. Actually, it may fail
   * unless you pick a different font that makes it more obvious what a 1 versus an l looks like.
